# PSO-Simulation
This code simulated PSO (Particle Swarm optimization) algorithm with five agents to find the path to destination.
There are two classes: Init-map.py will create a grid map with size of 10 cells. Python 3.4 is used to write to program.
In each running, PSO algorithm would generate a different path to destination.
